## Usage

Add this directory to your `load-path`

```
(require 'org-auto-tag)
```

`M-x org-auto-tag`

Press a key other than `n` to set (or define) a tag.
Press `n` to replace a tag.

## Alternatives

You might prefer to use some sort of completion (like `helm` or similar) for this completion. I find this is a little too distracting.
